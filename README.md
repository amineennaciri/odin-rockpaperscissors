This is the Rock Paper Scissors project from TOP(the odin project) foundations course.

This project is about building a simple implementation of the rock paper scissors game from the browser console.

The website will consist of a main html index page with a script tag. 

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my JAVASCRIPT knowledge.


Self-reflection and conclusion:
This project was an opportunity to test my javascript knowledge, I was able to create a rockpaperscissors Game, with 5 sets.
The game announce a winner at the end of the 5 sets, due to the commulative wins, ties or loses of both the computer and the player.
